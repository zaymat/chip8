# chip8 emulator

The goal of this project is to create a CHIP 8 emulator in C++ using SFML for graphics.

## CHIP 8
CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for said computers. (Wikipedia)

## Structure
The emulator is represented by two classes : CPU and GPU (which treat Keyboard interrupt too, because the window is generated by this class).

The main function fetch and parse the opcode and call the right function whether a CPU or a GPU method.

## Improvements

* Emulate sound to hear to BEEP sound of the machine
* Do the opcode parsing outside the main function
* Implement Super CHIP 8 opcodes (maybe I'll do another project because screen size is not the same)
* Work on frequency emulation, as today games are not fluid
